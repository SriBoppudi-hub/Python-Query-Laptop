Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of laptops to predict prices using regression models. Key steps include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features (e.g., TouchScreen, ScreenResolutionType).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing price distributions and relationships between variables.

Model Development: Training regression models to predict prices.
